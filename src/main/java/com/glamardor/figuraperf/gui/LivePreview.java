 * wrong here: every setting is about how many avatars survive around you, and a limit you cannot
 * see the result of is a limit set by trial and error, three menu round trips at a time. So the
 * widgets are read every tick and written straight into the live config.
 *
 * <p>That leaves the promise Cloth makes – that escape discards your edits – which is worth keeping.
 * The config is copied when the screen opens and copied back when it closes without a save.
